Assign, Cmpr, Cond, Decl, DeclInt, DeclRef, DeclSeq, Expr, Factor, Id, IdList, If
Input, Loop, Main, Memory, Output, Parser, Program, StmtSeq, Term, all handle
the nonterminal parts of the parse tree, specifically parsing, printing, and executing 
the parse tree.
scanner tokenizes input
parser handles the parse operations
memory handles the memory related operations when executing the parse tree
Func handles each function including parsing and executing
FuncCall handles calling each function

memory is divided into three fields, global where all global variables reside in a
map, static which is a list of lists of maps, and heap which is a list. each variable in a map
has an ID and a seperate class with type and value, type being int or ref. memory
handles updating all these variables and retreiving values. scope is handled with memory
searching the most recent stack memory and only cheching older scope if the variable
doesn't exist in the new scope. static scope is checked if the variable does not exist in 
the stack scope.  
the stack of scopes exist within a frame the memory only interacts with it's current frame 
execpt in the case that a function is being passed variables from a previous frame
when the program starts or a function is called a frame is created and appended to the stack 
along with a new scope, when the program or a function ends that frame is popped from the stack

along the heap there is also a reference count, whenever there is a new entry in the heap a new
entry is added to the refrence count, whenever a reference variable refrences that heap entry, the
corresponding reference count is incremented by one. Whenever a scope is exited the program checks 
all reference variables in that scope to see if they point to an entry in the heap, if they do
the corresponding entry in the refrence counts is decremented by one, and if that entry becomes
zero, the heap entry and refrence count entry are both removed.

there is no known bugs in the code as tested by the provided test cases
